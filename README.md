# DontGetHit
Python Game that takes inspiration from "World's Hardest Game"
WASD for movement (Up,Left,Down,Right)
M sends you back to the main menu
the goal is to reach the teal rectangles to move to the next level
you need the yellow squares(keys) to progress through the grey gates
if you get hit by an 'enemy' (blue rectangle) youll be sent back to your last spawnpoint
spawnpoints can be set by going to the purple rectangles which are checkpoints!
